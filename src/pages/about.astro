        Tūhura Tech is a group of tech-savvy and education-focused individuals who saw a need for better technology
        education resources for students and schools in the Wellington area. Driven by a passion for technology and
        education, we founded Tūhura Tech to provide consistent and comprehensive support for those looking to learn
        about technology. Our team is dedicated to helping students and schools grow their technological knowledge and
        skills to prepare them for the future. <br /><br /> With a focus on quality and accessibility, Tūhura Tech offers
        a range of resources, including educational programs and workshops, designed to meet the needs of students and schools.
        We believe that technology plays a critical role in shaping the future, and we are committed to empowering students
        and schools with the tools and knowledge they need to succeed.
