          At the core of what we do is our After School Sessions where we work
          with Rangatahi to inspire them to explore different areas of
          technology.Sessions cover a variety of topics with junior sessions
          (year 5-8) being slightly structured and senior sessions (year 9-13)
          functioning as a place to explore interests with support from our
          staff. This means that rangatahi are always engaged and learning.
        </p><p class="text-lg text-gray-800 dark:text-neutral-200">
          Junior Sessions (Year 5-8) follow a rough structure where they will
          focus on a topic such as Introduction to Programming with Scratch for
          a Term before moving to another topic. These sessions while focused
          ona topic are guided by their individual interests with a custom path
          through created specifically for them.
        </p><p class="text-lg text-gray-800 dark:text-neutral-200">
          Our Senior sessions (Year 9-13) are more relaxed and casual with
          everyone working on different projects and interests and a small
          section doing a set subject. This is a space to explore and experiment
          with the support of our staff or come along and focus on a topic that
          changes every term.

        As we've grown, we've seen how Preline has helped companies such as
        Spotify, Microsoft, Airbnb, Facebook, and Intercom bring their designers
        closer together to create amazing things. We've also learned that when
        the culture of sharing is brought in earlier, the better teams adapt and
        communicate with one another.

          Preline allows us to collaborate in real time and is a really great

        Small teams and individual designers need a space where they can watch
        the design process unfold, both for themselves and for the people they
        work with â€“ no matter if it's a fellow designer, product manager,
        developer or client. Preline allows you to invite more people into the
        process, creating a central place for conversation around design. As
        those teams grow, transparency and collaboration becomes integrated in
        how they communicate and work together.
